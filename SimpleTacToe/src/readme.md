# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe â€“ Simple Java Implementation

This is a **minimal, object-oriented implementation** of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Java.  
The design focuses on **clarity**, **simplicity**, and core game logic without overengineering.

---

## âœ… Key Components

- **Player**  
  Represents a player with a name and symbol (`X` or `O`)

- **Board**  
  Manages the 3x3 grid, cell updates, and win/draw checks

- **Game**  
  Controls the game flow, turn switching, and input handling

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity First**  
  Avoided complex patterns like Strategy or MVC to keep the code lean and readable

- **Single Responsibility**  
  Each class has a clear, focused role

- **Extensibility Ready**  
  Can be easily refactored later to support AI, larger boards, or GUI
